//PseudoCode for Task 1//
1. Cube of a number num is cube = num * num * num.
2. write a separate function for this simple statement.
3. assign a name to the function, example cube().
4. The function should accept a number whose cube is to be calculated. Hence, function definition is
cube(double num).
5. Finally, the function should return cube of num passed. Hence, return type of function should be
double.
6. After observing above points function declaration looks like double cube(double num);
